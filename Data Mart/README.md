 ## Introduction
 
 Danny embarked upon a new venture of online supermrket that specialises in  fresh produce and is named as DATA MART. After running international operations for his online supermarket, Danny is asking for  support to analyse his sales performance. 
In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.


## Problem Statement

Danny needs  help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it’s separate business areas.

The key business question to be answered are following--

* What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
* Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
* What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?



## Dataset Used
For this case study there is only a single table: data_mart.weekly_sales

The columns are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:

* Data Mart has international operations using a multi-`region` strategy.
* Data Mart has both, a `retail` and online platform in the form of a ` Shopify` store front to serve their customers.
* Customer `segment` and `customer_type` data relates to personal age and demographics information that is shared with Data Mart.
* `Transactions` is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and `sales` is the actual dollar amount of purchases.
