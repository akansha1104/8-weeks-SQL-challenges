## 🔖 Reporting Challenge

Write a single SQL script that combines all of the previous questions into a scheduled report that the Balanced Tree team can run at the beginning
of each month to calculate the previous month’s values.

Imagine that the Chief Financial Officer (which is also Danny) has asked for all of these questions at the end of every month.

He first wants you to generate the data for January only - but then he also wants you to demonstrate that you can easily run the samne 
analysis for February without many changes (if at all).

Feel free to split up your final outputs into as many tables as you need - but be sure to explicitly reference which table outputs relate
to which question for full marks.



## 🎁 Bonus Challenge

Use a single SQL query to transform the `product_hierarchy` and `product_prices` datasets to the `product_details` table.

Hint: you may want to consider using a recursive CTE to solve this problem!
