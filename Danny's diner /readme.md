## Introduction

This case study is about a small restaurant named DANNY'S DINER owned by Danny himself. Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, so
he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen. 🍣 🍛 🍜
Danny’s Diner is in need of  assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat -the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months
of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.



## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and
also which menu items are their favourite. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.
